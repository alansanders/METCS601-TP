# Boston University MET CS 601 Term Project
## Project Overview
This is a website for my term project for Boston University MET CS 601.

The goal of this project is to create a personal site that showcases my understanding of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Vue. The intended audience for this website is someone coming to learn more about my professional experience with the intent of hiring me for a development position or in a technical role.

This site has six html pages: 
1. index.html: an entry point to the site
2. bio.html: a brief professional biography
3. interests.html: a page dedicated to my personal interests
4. resume.html: a resume page
5. projects.html: highlights of projects that I've worked on
6. contact.html: a contact form

The overall intent of this site is to show that I've demonstrated mastery of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Vue. The site accomplishes this here:
* The site uses HTML5 tags, and passes validation for HTML and CSS.
* There is one main css file used to govern the layout of the site.
* The resume page uses JavaScript to fetch JSON information for the resume and updates the DOM.
* The project page is a gallery using Vue and allows a site visitor to hover over my accomplishments to learn more about my experience.
* The contact form validates a person's email address, an uses CSS styling to make it aesthetically pleasing.
