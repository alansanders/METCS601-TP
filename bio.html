                <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
                <p class="overview">Currently, I've been serving as the Director of Marketing Operations since February 2021, and I've played a crucial role in driving the success of our marketing campaigns and creative asset production, contributing to a substantial revenue stream of $1.2 billion. In my previous role as the Director of Marketing and Product Strategy from August 2018 to February 2021, I excelled as the product owner for critical platforms like Workfront and Salesforce (Force.com), playing a pivotal role in product roadmap development and feature prioritization. My achievements include delivering the Workfront project on time and within budget, saving the company a substantial $220,000 in licensing fees and server costs. My versatile skill set also extends to agile product ownership, with experience in SCRUM and Kanban methodologies. I consistently engage with internal customers to define requirements, understand business processes, and present product roadmaps. Moreover, I have effectively managed and mentored business analysis managers responsible for requirements gathering and the transition to new platforms.</p>
                <p class="overview">My career trajectory also includes a one-year seven-month tenure as the Director of Business Relationship Management from January 2017 to July 2018, where I served as a strategic liaison between the IT department and various business partners, driving the alignment of IT services with business demands. I managed a substantial portfolio of over $20 million in capital projects and collaborated with IT organizations to develop multi-year business capability roadmaps and estimate resources for project funding. My previous roles, including Senior Digital Marketing Manager and Manager of Product Management and Digital Marketing, are marked by my contributions to the development and strategic direction of mobile applications, global SEO initiatives, and the creation of an affiliate program generating over $3 million in hotel booking revenue. My dedication to data-driven decision-making is further highlighted in my role as a Direct Marketing Analyst, where I provided invaluable insights to enhance ROI and profitability in direct marketing campaigns through my expertise in tools like Showcase and SAS. My professional journey showcases a blend of strong leadership, strategic vision, and a solid foundation in marketing, making me an asset to any organization I engage with.</p>
